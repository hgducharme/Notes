## Getting around
* Use the metro as much as you can. Use the bicitaxis in downtown Mexico. **Don’t** use taxis in the streets.
* ECOBICI is a bike rental service like Ofo 
* Apparently Sixt is a good rental car service. Other rental services will try to bait and switch and pull annoying tactics on you

- - - -

* Dont say no, say gracias in an up beat voice! No is considered rude
* **Speaking of other customs in regards to kindness: say hello (hola) and goodbye (hasta luego, not adios) to everyone you interact with from shopkeepers to uber drivers to people you buy food from and everyone in between. People thought I was very rude when I didn’t greet them. Also, buenos días, buenas tardes, and buenas noches are good ways to greet people and say goodbye as well.**
* buy water from grocery store
* tip grocery baggers
* Acrópolis Mall, Mexico City, Mexico. - Abandoned mall
